# nlp_getting_started

Kaggle project https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview. Code is a bit messy but gets the job done. Functions in ./model.py, code for predictions in ./src/final_model.py

The approach taken is a stacked combination of a text model and and feature model, using tensorflow. Final accuracy is ~78, which I couldn't consistently beat. The training data is small so I think this is the main reason why accuracy appears to have a cap.
